Wiki on the Robotis Darwin OP

The purpose of this wiki is to provide Darwin OP users a location for collecting, discussing and contributing links or content on both software and hardware to do with Darwin-OPs.

https://github.com/dwicke/darwin-wiki/wiki  -- location of the wiki

Another possible use could be a place to discuss problems and issues in order to develop solutions.  That process could begin in the issues area https://github.com/dwicke/darwin-wiki/issues.  Once a solution to the issue is found, a new wiki page or a page could be added to.

Note that anyone with a github account can add to the wiki or the issues pages without having to be added as a contributor to this repo.  Also, the wiki can be cloned by doing:

git clone git@github.com:dwicke/darwin-wiki.wiki.git
