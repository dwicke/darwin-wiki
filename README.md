Wiki on the Robotis Darwin OP

The purpose of this wiki is to provide users of the Darwin OP a location for collecting, discussing and contributing both software and hardware for jumpstarting their research and helping to grow the darwin community.

https://github.com/dwicke/darwin-wiki/wiki  General software solutions for vision calibration, automatic servo calibration tools and hardware hacks such replacing the camera, or schematics for battery and helmet are just a few subjects we would like to see on the wiki.  Also, interested in different code bases for bootstraping the development process, installation guides/tips.

It is also a place to discuss problems and issues in order to develop solutions.  That process should begin in the issues area https://github.com/dwicke/darwin-wiki/issues.  Once a solution to the issue is created a new wiki page or a modification to a page should be developed.

Currently since the George Mason Robotics lab is the only participant (me and David) we will post the solutions we have developed to various problems we have encountered.

Note that anyone with a github account can add to the wiki or the issues pages without having to be added as a contributor to this repo.

Thanks!
